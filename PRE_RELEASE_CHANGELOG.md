# Pre-Release Changelog

## Unreleased

## Features

## Bug Fixes

- **Fetch request headers:** Preserve the resolved request headers when forwarding `fetchOptions`, preventing an inherited `Object.prototype.headers` value from replacing caller headers during RequestInit conversion in Node. (**[#11263](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/11263)**, **[#11394](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/11394)**)

## Documentation

- **Error identification:** Corrected the error `name` description in the README and English, French, Spanish, and Chinese error-handling guides. Cancellation errors use `CanceledError`, and wrapped errors may retain their original name, so the guides now recommend `axios.isAxiosError(error)` for identifying Axios errors and `axios.isCancel(error)` for detecting cancellations instead of comparing `name`. Documentation only; no runtime, public API, or type changes. ([#11374](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/11374))
- **v1.21.0 release notes and docs:** Added the published v1.21.0 release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`. Applied the 13 pending `PRE_RELEASE_DOCS.md` entries from v1.20.0 and v1.21.0 to the English, Spanish, French, and Chinese docs site, including upgrade-guide sections for both releases. Cleared the released entries from `PRE_RELEASE_CHANGELOG.md`, and reduced `PRE_RELEASE_DOCS.md` to the README updates that remain pending for those entries. No runtime, public API, or type compatibility changes.
